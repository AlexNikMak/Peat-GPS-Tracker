# 🌍 Peat-GPS-Tracker

## 🔰 Introduction

`Peat-GPS-Tracker` is an *open project focused on building a GPS tracker for pets*.  
In the future, it can be adapted for various tasks, but the **main goal** is to provide a simple, compact, and accurate solution for tracking animals.  
The project is currently in the early planning and requirement-gathering stage.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Peat-GPS-Tracker has several key objectives, grouped into three main directions:

### 1. 📚 Learning and Development

One of my personal primary goals is to gain and improve knowledge and skills across various fields covered by this project.  
I aim not only to learn but also to share knowledge with others to inspire interest and progress in technical creativity.

The project is focused on:  
A. Searching and studying technical documentation of electronic components, analyzing their features and interactions  
B. Developing project management skills for a large, long-term initiative  
C. Practicing technical skills in areas such as electrical engineering and microelectronics — schematic creation, simulation, PCB design, and working with PCB manufacturers

### 2. 🐾 Building a Device Missing from the Market

Another key goal is to build the device I couldn't find available for my own cat.  
The reasons included:  
A. Restrictions in policies of existing companies  
B. Incompatibility of existing devices with my specific needs  
C. Overpricing or unavailability in my region  

My version of the device should be accessible, open-source, compact, and functional.

### 3. 💸 Potential Monetization

Lastly, while not the top priority, the possibility of receiving financial reward for the time and effort spent is also considered.  
Since the project is complex and long-term, the chance to earn income from it in the future is appealing.

> ⚠️ There is currently no specific monetization strategy.  
> This section will be updated as the project progresses.

## 🔧 Core Device Features

1. Accurate GPS location tracking (preferably with 1-meter precision)  
2. Real-time location display via web or mobile interface  
3. Long-term GPS data logging  
4. Integration with existing tracking software such as [Traccar](https://www.traccar.org/)  
5. Battery level monitoring and low-battery alerts  
6. Remote configuration and firmware updates (OTA)

> 🛠️ The list of features may change as the project develops.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

> ℹ️ *At this stage, the roadmap is included here.  
> In the future, it will be moved to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/AlexNikMak/projects)*
