# 🌍 Peat-GPS-Tracker

## 🔰 Introduction

`Peat-GPS-Tracker` is an *open-source project focused on creating a GPS tracker for pets*.  
While it can potentially be adapted for other use cases, the **primary goal** is to provide a simple, compact, and reliable solution for pet tracking.  
The project is currently in the early planning and requirements-gathering phase.
