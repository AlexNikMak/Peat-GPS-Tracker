# 🌍 Peat-GPS-Tracker

## 🔰 Introduction

`Peat-GPS-Tracker` is an *open-source project focused on creating a GPS tracker for pets*.  
While it can potentially be adapted for other use cases, the **primary goal** is to provide a simple, compact, and reliable solution for pet tracking.  
The project is currently in the early planning and requirements-gathering phase.

## 🎯 Project Goals
The Peat-GPS-Tracker project pursues several key objectives, which can be grouped into three main directions:

1. 📚 Learning and Personal Development
One of my main personal goals is to gain and improve knowledge and skills in the various fields involved in this project. I aim not only to learn but also to share knowledge with others to foster growth and interest in technical creativity.

This project focuses on:

A. Searching for and studying technical documentation of electronic components, understanding their properties and how they interact;

B. Developing project management skills for large, long-term projects;

C. Gaining hands-on experience in technical disciplines such as electrical engineering and microelectronics — including circuit design, simulation using appropriate software, PCB development, and working with PCB manufacturers.

2. 🐾 Creating a Device That Is Missing from the Market
Another major goal is to build a device that I couldn’t find available on the market for my cat. The reasons include:

limitations imposed by existing companies' policies;

inadequate or excessive functionality;

high cost or lack of availability in my region.

The goal is to make the device open, accessible, compact, and tailored to real user needs.

3. 💸 Potential Monetization
Finally, an important (though not primary) objective is the potential for financial return for the time and effort invested in this complex and long-term project.

⚠️ Currently, there is no clear monetization strategy. This section may be updated later as the project evolves.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

> ℹ️ *This roadmap is currently maintained in the README. It will be moved to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/AlexNikMak/projects) in the future.*

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Repository initialized
- [x] Multilingual README created
- [x] License file added with defined usage policy

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Defining clear project goals and technical requirements

### 🧠 Planned
- [ ] Selecting core components (GPS, microcontroller, communication, power supply)
- [ ] Reviewing technical documentation for selected modules
- [ ] Designing power circuit and PCB layout
- [ ] Prototyping the first version

## 🔧 Getting Started

The project is still in its early stages. If you’d like to get involved or follow the development:

1. Visit the [firmware/](firmware) folder — will contain firmware source code *(coming soon)*  
2. Visit the [hardware/](hardware) folder — will include schematics, components list, and related files *(coming soon)*  
3. Watch for updates in the [Issues](../../issues) or GitHub Projects tab
